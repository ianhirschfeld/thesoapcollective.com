      <p class="font-lato-300">Standing in the desert, dust swirls at your feet. Black storms rage over megalithic structures in the distance. A voice echoes in your ear, beckoning to you: “Find me...” You do not know her, but her call feels like a memory. Your grip tightens on the controls of your vehicle as the engine roars to life. The wind whips at the tatters of your jacket. Like a bolt in the storm, you jet off into the wasteland beyond. </p>
      <p class="font-lato-300">Atlas is an original science fiction event series from The Soap Collective. Awaken to a place lost to time, with secrets waiting to be uncovered around every corner. </p>
      <p class="font-lato-300">Welcome to the world beyond. Welcome to Atlas.</p>
      <p class="font-futura-700 font-futura-normal">Coming in 2017</p>
