      <p class="font-lato-300">We collaborated with Phoodie to bring you a social media experience that pairs best with a good meal.</p>
      <p class="font-lato-300">Phoodie was already a great idea, we just helped make it better. Coming on board early in the process, Soap helped Phoodie take their production prototype and make it consumer-ready.</p>
      <p class="font-lato-300">We developed a scalable backend, mobile API, and worked closely with their team on app design touch-ups. We also designed and built the Phoodie web page!</p>
      <p class="font-lato-300">Our partnership with Phoodie continues, with Soap stepping in to assist with development updates and feature releases.</p>
      <p class="font-lato-300">Come dine with us! Letâ€™s share in the Phoodie Life together:</p>
