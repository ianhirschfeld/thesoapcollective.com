      <p class="font-lato-300">We worked with artist Cameron Grey to create a 360 music video experience for his song “Never Bout Us”.</p>
      <p class="font-lato-300">Together, we worked to create an immersive story that flows smoothly through the 360° space. The audience follows Cameron as he relives the memories of a brutal breakup.</p>
      <p class="font-lato-300">To support the video experience, we created an app for iOS and Android that allows people to easily view it using both their phone and a cardboard VR viewer.</p>
      <p class="font-lato-300">We also designed the website, social media, and press materials to accompany the song and video release. Included in this was a series of limited-run boxes that contained a custom-branded VR viewer, thank you note, production credits, and 1-of-a-kind instant photos from the video shoot. Cameron then hand-wrote the lyrics inside every box, ensuring that each one was unique.</p>
