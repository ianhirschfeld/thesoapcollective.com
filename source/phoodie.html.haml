      %h3.normal A Social Network Built Exclusively for Foodies
      %p We collaborated with Phoodie to bring you a social media experience that pairs best with a good meal.
      %p Phoodie was already a great idea, we just helped make it better. Coming on board early in the process, Soap helped Phoodie take their production prototype and make it consumer-ready.
      %p We developed a scalable backend, mobile API, and worked closely with their team on app design touch-ups. We also designed and built the Phoodie web page!
      %p Our partnership with Phoodie continues, with Soap stepping in to assist with development updates and feature releases.
      %p Come dine with us! Letâ€™s share in the Phoodie Life together:
